To check whether third character of string is vowel or consonant.
Take input String from user and store it in string variable "s".
To extract third character of string we are using a inbulit method "string.charAt(index)" which will return character at particular index.
To work for all cases of character we are converting into lowercase by using "Character.toLowerCase(c)" which will return lower case charcter.
Then we are using if condition to check whether character is vowel or consonant by using follwing condition (c=='a' || c=='e' || c=='i' || c== 'o' || c=='u') if any one condition is true print Third Character of String is Vowel.
If if condition fails then in else block print the statement that character is consonant.
